This demo project demonstrates how to create a lightning effect for your Sprite Kit game. 


The project contains three ways to create a lightning:
- by using SKShapeNode
- by using CAShapeLayer
- by using SKSpriteNode (best way IMHO, enabled by default)

If you want to try another approach, such as SKShapeNode or CAShapeLayer do the following:
- open SpriteKitLightning\ViewController.m file
- replace Scene3 by Scene1 or Scene2 respectively

Please refer to http://www.andreygordeev.com/posts/lightning blog post for more info.

I realize that these approaches may be not ideal, so pull requests are welcome!
